\title{Check the status for a list of plant names according to TBGRI and The Plant List 

}
\description{Check the status of a vector of plant taxon names, according to the Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute (TBGRI) and The Plant List (TPL). The function relies on the TreeGhats database. It removes orthographical errors in taxon names and provides the accepted names according to TBGRI and TPL. A synthese between TPL and TBGRI is done and a status, a reference name and a reference authority are proposed. The family according to APGIII is provided if \code{apg = TRUE}.  The origin, the habit and the phenology of the taxon are provided if \code{othersinfo = TRUE}.The IUCN status of the taxon is provided if \code{iucn = TRUE}.

\usage{
taxocheck(names, othersinfo = TRUE, iunc = TRUE, max.distance = 2)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
\item{names}{A vector of taxon names, each element including the genus, the specific epithet and, additionally, the infraspecific epithet. The authority of the taxon name should not be included.
}
\item{othersinfo}{Logical. If 'TRUE' (default), then the origin, the habit and the phenology are provided for the taxon names found in the TreeGhats database.
}
\item{iucn}{Logical. If 'TRUE' (default), the IUCN status is provided for the reference name proposed.
}
\item{max.distance}{Maximum distance allowed for a match in agrep function when performing corrections of spelling errors.
}
}

\details{
The procedure searches for a vector of taxon name in The Plant List (TPL) and provides its taxonomic status.
First, the function standardizes the taxon names by removing unnecessary spaces, checking for incomplete names, i.e. missing species epithet or names including a number and  homogenising abbreviations of intraspecific rank. Then the function searches taxon names in the TreeGhats database and provides their taxonomic status according to TPL and TBGRI. Differences in typos can be detected depending on the arguments 'max.distance'. Some caution is recommended in increasing 'max.distance' as false match can be done. If the taxon name is absent from the database, the function used a modified version of the function \code{TPLck} (see ) in order to provides the taxonomic status of the taxon according to TPL.
if \code{othersinfo = T},the origin, the habit, the phenology and the IUCN status of the taxon are provided, but only for taxon names present in the TreeGhats database.
}
\value{
The function return an object of class \code{data.frame} with the following components:

  \item{FoundName}{Taxon names as found in TBGRI or TPL. Orthographic errors are corrected.}
  
  \item{Typo}{Logical. If 'TRUE' there was a spelling error in the taxon name provided that has been corrected.}
  
  \item{ID_TPL}{The Plant List record 'id'.}
  
  \item{Status_TPL}{Taxonomic status found in TPL, either 'Accepted', 'Synonym', 'Unresolved', or 'Misapplied'. \code{NA} indicates taxon names not found in TPL. When TPL found several homonyms for the taxon name provided the function returns 'TPLfoundSeveralHomonyms'.}
  
  \item{ReferenceName_TPL}{The valid form of the taxon name, extrated from TPL.}
  
  \item{ReferenceAuthority_TPL}{Names of the scientist(s) who first published the reference name, extracted from TPL.}
  
  \item{NewID_TPL}{The Plant List record 'id' for the reference name, extracted from TPL.}
  
  \item{Status_TBGRI}{Taxonomic status found in TBGRI, either 'Absent', 'Accepted', 'Synonym', 'Unresolved'. 'Absent' designes species names not found in TBGRI.}
  
  \item{ReferenceName_TBGRI}{The valid form of the taxon name, extrated from TBGRI.}
  
  \item{ReferenceAuthorithy_TBGRI}{Names of the scientist(s) who first published the reference name, extracted from TBGRI.}
  
  \item{Status_proposed}{Taxonomic status proposed, either 'Accepted', 'Synonym', 'Unresolved'. When a name is absent from TreeGhats database and TPL found several homonyms for the taxon name provided the function returns 'TPLfoundSeveralHomonyms'. When the taxon name is incomplete (missing species epithet or included a number), the function returns 'IncompleteName' as Status_proposed}
  
  \item{ReferenceName_proposed}{The valid form of the taxon name proposed.}
  
  \item{ReferenceAuthorithy_proposed}{Names of the scientist(s) who first published the reference name proposed.}
  
  \item{Family_APGIII}{Family name according to APGIII for the taxon reference name proposed.}
  
  \item{Genus}{Genus of taxon reference name proposed.}
  
  \item{Species}{Specific epithet  of taxon reference name proposed.}
  
  \item{InfrataxonRank}{Intraspecific rank of taxon reference name proposed.}
  
  \item{InfrataxonName}{Intraspecific epithet of taxon reference name proposed.}
  
  \item{Origin}{if \code{othersinfo = T}, the origin of the plant according to TBGRI or IFP expertise when the taxon name is not present in TBGRI, either 'exotic', 'endemic of india' or 'native'.}
  
  \item{Habit}{if \code{othersinfo = T}, the habit of the plant according to TBGRI or IFP expertise when the taxon name is not present in TBGRI, either 'liana', 'shrub', 'tree','...','unknown' ,or any combination of these terms.}
  
  \item{Phenology}{if \code{othersinfo = T}, the leaves phenology of the plant according to IFP expertise, either 'evergreen' or 'deciduous'.}
  
  \item{IUCN}{if \code{iucn = T}, the IUCN status, either 'CR', 'DD', 'EN', 'EX', 'LC', 'LR/cd', 'LR/lc', 'LR/nt', 'NE', 'NT', 'VU' for the reference name proposed. The search is done at the species level.}

\note{The function only consider subspecies, varieties and forms.
The function relies on the TreeGhats database, which is included in the package. This database will be updated.}
 

\section{Warning}{The running time of the function depends on the length of the taxon names vector and which arguments are TRUE (if iucn the running time is longer).

The function uses internet connection to check names in TPL and get the family according to APG III and the IUCN status.

The function return the warnings relative to the use of the \code{TLPck2} function.}
