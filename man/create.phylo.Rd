\title{
Generating a phylogeny of selected Western Ghats trees}
\description{
Creates a phylogenic tree of taxa based on species, genus and APGIII family information}
\usage{
create.phylo(names = NULL, scenarios = "S3")
create.phylo.all()
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{names}{Table including taxonomic information for each taxon on row, and columnes denoted "Binome", "Genus" and "Family_APGIII", with latine genus species combination, genus name and APGIII complying family name, respectively. Genus and species names in "Binome" must be separated with a space.
  With default value NULL, the phylogeny is generated for all the taxa of the TreeGhats database.
}
  \item{scenarios}{One of the scenarios of Qian and Jin (2015) proposed for including taxa that are not already present in the worldwide phylogeny.
