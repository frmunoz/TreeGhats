\title{Western Ghats tree database
}
\description{
A comprehensive database of tree taxa of the Western Ghats with up-to-date taxonomic reference. It contains taxon names that have been commonly used in forest ecology research on Western Ghats. It also considers infrataxon level. The database is dynamic and will be updated.

\details{
The database is a compilation of different taxa lists :
taxa for which the word "tree" appeared in habit in the book Flowering plants of the western Ghats edited by the Tropical Botanic Garden Research Institute (TBGRI) including planted or cultivated taxa; Taxon described after 2014; taxon names used in studies done in different parts of the Western Ghats by the French institut of Pondicherry (IFP) or from 2000 and for which the list of taxa is published; taxon names reported as "tree" growth form used in the Indian Biodiversity Portail (\url{http://indiabiodiversity.org/}). As most of studies did not distinguish the infraspecific level, for each infra species (sub-species, variety or form), we automatically add the species level as an entry in our taxonomic database. The addition of the species level correspond to a degraded information. Indeed, according to the International code of nomenclature, the publication of an infrataxon name automatically created the infrataxon autonym corresponding to the taxon level.

\note{
Two limitations of the database have been identified. First, it does not content all synomym names for a taxon. Second, the attribution of 'tree' as a growth form to a taxon depends on the criteria used in the study and/or on the study area. This can be explain missing taxa in the database.  The database will be updated at least every two years or more often depending on the requests send to <treeghats@gmail.com>. }
