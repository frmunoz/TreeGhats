\title{Western Ghats tree database}
\description{
A comprehensive database Western Ghats (WG) tree taxa with up-to-date taxonomic reference. It contains taxon names that have been commonly used in forest ecology research on Western Ghats. It also considers infrataxon level. The database is dynamic and will be updated.

\details{
The database is a compilation of different taxa lists :
taxa for which the word "tree" appears in habit/growth form in the Flowering plants of the Western Ghats, book edited by the Tropical Botanic Garden Research Institute (TBGRI), including planted or cultivated taxa and in the Indian Biodiversity Portail (\url{http://indiabiodiversity.org/}); taxa described after 2014; taxon names used in studies done in different parts of the Western Ghats by the French institut of Pondicherry (IFP) or from 2000 with published lists of taxa. As most of studies did not distinguish the infraspecific level, for each infra species (sub-species, variety or form), we automatically add the species level as an entry in our taxonomic database. The database includes also basic ecological and biogeographical informormation and the conservation status according to IUCN.
The version of the database available in TreeGhats package has been published on Zenodo on August 21st (https://zenodo.org/record/846291).

\note{
The database is not exhaustive but will be updated and completed regularly. The priority has been to include the most commonly used taxon names, so the database does not content all the known synonyms for a taxon. The attribution of 'tree' as a growth form to a taxon depends on the criteria used in the study and/or on the environmental conditions of the study area. It can explain missing taxa in the database and the inclusion of some shrubs or lianas according to TBGRI flora, as they have been reported in forest plots with a GBH larger than 10 cm.}
